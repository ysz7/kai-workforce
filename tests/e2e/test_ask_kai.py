"""Phase 7's Definition of Done, through the surfaces a person actually uses.

*The user states a goal in one sentence and gets a verified result, without ever
addressing an employee.* So nothing here names one: the requests are sentences,
and which employee did what is read back afterwards as evidence, not supplied.

The whole stack is real - the CLI, FastAPI, the container, SQLite on a temporary
file, the manager, the employee runtime - with one thing scripted: the model,
because the suite runs without a provider key.
