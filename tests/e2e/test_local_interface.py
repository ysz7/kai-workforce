"""Phase 6's Definition of Done: a task is run and finished from the interface.

The whole stack is real - FastAPI, the container, SQLite on a temporary file,
the employee runtime, the approval gate - with two things scripted: the model,
because the suite runs without a provider key, and the employee declaration,
which is read from the repository's own `employees/` directory.

The interface is exercised the way a browser exercises it: post a goal, watch
the stream, open the history, answer a question, stop a run.
