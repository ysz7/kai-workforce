"""Capability-aware routing.

A caller says what the work needs - reasoning, tools, a long context, a budget -
and gets back a model. It never says which one, which is what makes swapping
models a change to `models.toml` rather than to any employee or to KAI.

The precedence is deliberate and worth stating plainly:

1. **Requirements filter.** A model that cannot do the work is never a candidate.
2. **The configured default wins** whenever it survives that filter. Editing
   `models.toml` must be enough to change which model runs, so a soft hint is
   not allowed to quietly route somewhere else - and somewhere more expensive.
3. **Hints rank the rest.** They decide only among candidates when the task kind
   has no default, or the default cannot do the work.

A caller who genuinely needs something else says so as a requirement, which
filters at step 1, rather than as a preference at step 3.
