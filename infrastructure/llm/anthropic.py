"""The Messages API, which is not the chat-completions format.

`ChatCompletionsProvider` covers the services that speak one shape. This one
genuinely differs on the wire, and the differences are not cosmetic:

* **The system prompt is a top-level field**, not a message with a role. A
  transcript that begins with a system turn has to be split, not translated.
* **Tool results are content blocks on a user message**, not a `tool` role. Two
  tool results in a row belong to *one* user message; sending them as two turns
  is a different conversation, and the model is trained on the first shape.
* **A tool call is a `tool_use` block with parsed input**, not a function call
  carrying a JSON string that has to be decoded (and can fail to).
* **`max_tokens` is required.** There is no server-side default to fall back on.
* **Usage is `input_tokens` / `output_tokens`**, not prompt/completion.

Three quirks are worth naming because getting them wrong is a 400 rather than a
worse answer. **Tool names may not contain a dot**, and every tool in this
platform is called `fs.read` or `code.run` - so names are translated on the way
out and translated back on the way in, because the name that comes back is what
the executor checks permissions against. Sampling parameters were removed on the
current top models, so `temperature` is sent only to the models that still take
it. And the JSON-object response format has no equivalent here - see `_payload`
for what is done instead.

Raw `httpx` rather than the `anthropic` package, for one reason: every adapter in
this directory translates a wire format into `domain.llm` values, and shares one
retry policy and one error taxonomy. An SDK would bring its own of both, and this
adapter would spend its time turning them back into ours.
