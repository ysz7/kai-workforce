"""A local model runner - Ollama and anything else with the same endpoint.

The wire format is the chat-completions one, so the work here is not the
protocol. It is everything around it:

* **No key.** There is nothing to authenticate to.
* **No cost.** Calls are priced at zero in the catalog, which is true rather
  than a placeholder. `kai spend` stays meaningful either way.
* **Slow.** A 20B model on a laptop answers in tens of seconds, not hundreds of
  milliseconds, so the default timeout is much larger than a hosted one.
* **A server that may not be running.** That is a configuration problem with a
  clear fix, and the error says so instead of reporting a mystery outage.
