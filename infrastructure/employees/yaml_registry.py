"""Loads employee declarations from `employees/*/employee.yaml`.

This is where "an employee is a declaration, not code" is actually enforced. If
adding an employee ever requires touching a Python file, it will be this one -
and that would be the bug.

It is strict about shape and says where the problem is. A declaration is written
by hand and read by nobody until something goes wrong with it, so `allowed_tool`
instead of `allowed_tools`, a temperature of 20, or a goal that is a dict with
no `text` would otherwise all fail silently - as an employee with no tools, a
model told to be maximally random, or a goal that reads as `{}`. Every one of
those is refused at load with the file that caused it.

What it deliberately does *not* check is anything about the machine: whether a
tool exists, whether a capability is backed. That needs the tool registry, it
differs between machines, and `domain.employees.validation` does it where both
are known.

It lives in `infrastructure/` rather than `application/` for the same reason the
task repository does: it reads from disk. The plan sketches it under
`application/workforce/`, but the layering rule it also states - application
depends on the domain only - puts file I/O here.
