"""The user's own machine, and the only capability here that can reach anything.

Everything else in the platform is confined by construction: the filesystem
tools cannot leave one directory, the browser cannot leave its tab. This one
can click anywhere, so it is the one place where the confinement has to be
argued rather than assumed. Four things stand between it and the machine:

1. **A flag.** `KAI_FLAGS__COMPUTER_USE` is off by default, and with it off this
   class is never built - the container does not import it.
2. **An optional dependency.** The native driver is an extra, imported at call
   time like Playwright, so installing the platform does not install a robot.
3. **`ComputerConstraints`,** applied by `GuardedComputer` in front of every
   action: which applications may be in front, which part of the screen may be
   touched, how many actions in total.
4. **Approval.** The desktop tools declare themselves irreversible, so every
   desktop action waits for a person. That is deliberately heavier than the
   browser surface - see docs/adr/0005.

The driver is synchronous and blocks for the duration of a click, so every call
goes through a thread. An event loop stalled behind a mouse move is an event
loop that cannot answer a stop signal.
