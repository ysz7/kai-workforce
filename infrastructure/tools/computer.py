"""Operating a screen, as five tools over three contracts.

The shape of the loop these tools are built for is: **look, act, check.** A
model that clicks and assumes is the failure mode Computer Use is famous for,
and it is not fixed by telling the model to be careful. So it is built into the
tools:

- `computer.screen` is the only way to find out where anything is, and it comes
  back with coordinates rather than prose;
- every acting tool takes an optional `expect`, and when it is given, the tool
  takes a second screenshot and asks whether the expected thing actually
  happened. The answer, not the assumption, is what goes into the observation;
- `computer.verify` asks the same question on its own, for a state that no
  single action produced.

Risk is read from the surface, not from the tool. The same click is a different
act depending on where it lands: in a page the platform opened, it is undone by
going back; on the user's own desktop it can be anything at all. So the browser
surface runs at MEDIUM and the desktop asks a person every time. See ADR 0005.
