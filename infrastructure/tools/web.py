"""Search and browsing, as three tools over two contracts.

`web.search` and the browser are kept apart on purpose. A question usually
needs a list of candidate sources, and answering it by loading pages costs a
browser launch and a page render per result. Searching is cheap; opening is
not, and the employee should be able to choose.

Opening and extracting are also separate, because a page load and reading what
loaded are separately observable: an employee that opened a page which returned
nothing should see that as its own step rather than as an empty answer.
