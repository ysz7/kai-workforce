"""A real browser, started only if someone actually opens a page.

Two decisions worth stating.

**The import is lazy.** Playwright is an optional extra: `uv sync` on a fresh
checkout should not download a browser engine for a user whose employees only
read files. Importing it at call time means the dependency is missing only for
the run that needs it, and the message says how to install it.

**Extraction returns text, not HTML.** A model given raw markup spends its
context on nav bars and script tags. `extract` returns the readable text of the
page, capped, with the title and the final URL after redirects - which is what
a claim needs to be attributable.
