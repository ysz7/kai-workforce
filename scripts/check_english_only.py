"""Fail if non-Latin script leaks into the codebase.

Mixed-language identifiers and log keys are ungreppable and undeliverable to
another developer or model, and Cyrillic table and column names break drivers
and encodings. The rule is cheap from the first commit and expensive to
introduce halfway.

Runtime *data* - task goals, memory contents, report text - may be in any
language. That is why only source and schema files are scanned, and why
`dev-assets/` (the internal planning notes) is excluded.
