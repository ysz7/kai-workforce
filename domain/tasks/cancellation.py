"""Stopping a task that is already running.

There is already a brake in the platform - `kai stop`, the STOP file - and it
deliberately stops one thing: anything acting on a screen. It is a blunt,
machine-wide switch, read immediately before an irreversible physical action,
and it is right for that job precisely because it is blunt.

Cancelling a task is a different question with a different answer. It names one
task out of several that may be running, it has to leave the task in a legal
terminal state with whatever it had produced so far, and it must not stop a
second task that happens to be running beside it. So it is asked per task, and
checked where a run can be interrupted without losing work: between steps, and
before a tool call is made.

Cooperative, not pre-emptive. Killing a coroutine mid-tool leaves the outside
world in whatever state the tool had reached and the task row describing a step
that never finished - which is exactly the failure `resume` exists to avoid.
