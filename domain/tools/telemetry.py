"""What a tool call cost and whether it worked.

Model calls have been accounted for since Phase 2 for a reason that applies to
tools just as much: a loop that is failing does not announce itself, it just
keeps calling. Recorded per call, arguments redacted, so a run can be read back
afterwards without leaking a credential into the store.
