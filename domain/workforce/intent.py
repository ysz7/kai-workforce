"""What a sentence from the user turns out to be asking for.

Between "the user typed something" and "there is a plan" sits a question the
plan (§7.3, §7.5) treats as two and which is really one: *what is being asked,
and does it need the workforce at all?*

Both are read at once, because they are answered from the same reading. A
sentence that wants a fact back needs no employee, no plan and no tools, and
decomposing it anyway produces a task whose whole content is the question that
was already asked. Decomposition is a means, not the product.

The user's own words are never replaced by this. A restatement is kept beside
them so a misreading is visible next to the sentence it came from, rather than
silently becoming the thing that gets worked on.
