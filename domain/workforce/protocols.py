"""The manager's contract.

Declared in Phase 1 so everything below it is written against a fixed shape;
implemented in Phase 7, once there is a dependable executor to manage.

The values here are the manager's vocabulary and nothing more. There is no
employee named anywhere in this file, and no way to name one: KAI reaches the
workforce through `EmployeeRegistry` and reaches the work through
`TaskExecution`, both of which it is handed.
