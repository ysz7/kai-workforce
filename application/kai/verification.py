"""KAI checks the work before the user sees it.

The employee runtime already verifies each task against its own goal. This is a
second, different check, and §7.8 is right to ask for it: a task can be
perfectly done and the objective still unmet. "Find twenty" decomposed into
"find some" and executed flawlessly produces eleven, and every verdict along the
way says pass.

So this judges the objective's acceptance criteria - written down before the
work started, precisely so the standard cannot be invented after seeing the
result - against everything that came back.

One consequence is worth stating: when the reading of the request produced no
criteria, the request itself is the standard. Passing by default there would
switch this check off exactly when comprehension had been weakest, which is the
opposite of what it is for.

Three rules hold it up. **A criterion with no evidence is unmet**, however
confident the reports read; the employee that did the work is the wrong witness
to whether it worked, and so is its summary. **An unreadable verdict is a
rejection**, because a checker that cannot be understood must not be allowed to
wave work through by failing quietly. And **a verdict that passes while naming
something missing has not passed** - that contradiction turned up in the first
real run of this phase, and reading it either way is a choice, so it is read the
safe way and logged.
