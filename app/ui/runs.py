"""The tasks this process is carrying, and how to stop one.

The CLI runs a task and waits for it; an interface cannot. A request that starts
a task has to return the moment the task exists, because the point of the page
is to watch the run - so the work goes onto the event loop and the request
returns an id.

That leaves this file owning the two things a background run needs and a
foreground one does not.

**A task must exist before its request returns.** `submit` writes the task and
its assignment, and only then is the run scheduled. A page that got an id back
for a task the database has never heard of would be lying, and a process killed
one second later would have nothing to resume.

**An objective is carried the same way, one level up.** Since Phase 7 the page
asks KAI for an outcome rather than handing a task to an employee, and KAI's own
work - reading the request, planning, delegating, checking - takes as long as
the tasks it starts. So it too goes on the loop and the request returns an
objective id, which is what the page then watches.

**Cancelling has two cases, and they are not the same.** A task this process is
running is asked to stop and stops itself between steps, keeping what it did. A
task that is *not* running - left behind by a killed process, or never started -
has nobody to ask, so it is moved to CANCELLED here. Conflating the two would
either leave a stale task uncancellable, or "cancel" a live run by writing a
terminal status underneath a loop that is still working.
